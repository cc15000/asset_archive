This is a prototype for a freelance project which I recently completed. The prototype consists of a main index.php file, plus several dependencies, all written in a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and Adobe Flex 4.6.

##Feedback

Constructive feedback is always welcome and appreciated. I'm relatively new at this, so try not to be too harsh.
